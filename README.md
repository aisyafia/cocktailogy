This is a project created following a YouTube tutorial provided by [`JavaScript Mastery`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU).

The original project is a clone of a car rental site, while I modified mine into a cocktail discovery project, utilizing The Cocktail DB from [`Rapid API`](https://rapidapi.com/hub).
